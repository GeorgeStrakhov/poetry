# Gospels out of tune

## Epigraph

Since I am coming to that holy room,
Where, with thy choir of saints for evermore,
I shall be made thy music; as I come
I tune the instrument here at the door,
And what I must do then, think here before.

- John Donne

## My Gardener

My Gardener, can you show yourself to me?
Your poor tree is thirsty for your sight.
How can I bloom, if I have always been
Pale, growing in your shadows, not your light?

My Gardener, can you hide yourself from me?
My leaves hurt, yet away I can not turn.
Your light is way too bright for me to see.
How can I blossom if my flowers burn?

Hence they are one, your shadow and your light,
Your everpresence hidden in plain sight.

## Make-believe

I’ll make-believe that I am but a child
Who wanders freely in the land of dreams
Where all-there-is comes out at him at once
And paves the way for all-that-there-can-be
And tickles all his senses… Just a child,
Who looks the world directly in the eye
And grasps all things, but doesn’t call them names
Or put them into boxes, where they die
Without the rest of things to rub against.
All times and places are to him alike,
Mind never still, heart always running wild,
He comes and goes away, as he may please.
I'll make-believe that I am just a child,
Who hasn’t yet forgotten who he is.
But it won't last. Too soon the rising tides
Will come and hide his primal soul beneath
The clouds of doubt and waves of second thoughts.
My child will grow. And with him - his distress.
His mind now circling in the land of ghosts
And fears that never seem to leave his chest...
He’ll push on through, though puzzled. Ever since
This life will be for him a lonely quest
That goes too quickly, but is never done.
He’ll be an old man soon with broken thoughts,
Who tapes them with the memories long gone.
And watches as they slowly fade away,
Except one thought that always seems to stay,
Yet he is never quite so sure which one.
And in the end when all he’s got is past
My poor child shall see his final dream,
A dream more vivid than he's ever seen,
Where hopes and fears let go of him at last,
Where he becomes what he has always been
And always will be. Amen! Quite a life.
As good as one can hope for in this land,
Where everything that has an end is pointless,
Yet everything that has a point must end.
I’ll stop here, there is nowhere else to go.
Where all ends meet I’ll take my final stand
And hold my breath… but how long can I keep it?
For what’s alive cannot be still for long...
There’s nothing here to lose, still less to gain,
I shall forget myself and start again.

## Who is that?

Who is that whistling ten thousand tunes, not getting out of breath?
Who is that blowing on ten thousand things, so each can be itself?
Who is that dancing in your twinkling eye, each time you smile at me?
Do you feel, Father, dear Father, how much I wish that I could see?

Who is that fighting in ten thousand battles, knowing not what for?
Who is that jumping out the windows, right next to the open doors?
Who is that riding on ten thousand waves in San Francisco bay?
Do you feel, Father, dear Father, how much I wish that I could say?

Who is that howling with ten thousand winds, but never blows away?
Who is that looking for ten thousand needles in one straw of hay?
Who is that flowing with the streams that always go from low to low?
Do you feel, Father, dear Father, how much I wish that I could know?

## I'll be there

When you wander through my forests,
Lost inside their endless maze,
When you feel so fixed upon you
Heaven's cold and careless gaze,
When you pray so hard, but no one
Seems around to hear your prayer,
Lift the stone and you shall find me,
Cleave the wood and I'll be there.

If you sail across my oceans,
Knowing not which way you're bound,
If you fight against your brothers,
Caring not where friends be found,
If your troubles seem like mountains,
You can move them, should you dare
Break your bread and you shall find me,
Drink your wine and I'll be there.

## Play me

Silence, be my bride!
Flow into my heart,
Make me come alive,
Till death do us part.
In your comsic choir,
I'm just a voice,
Body made of strings
Of the Universe.
Play me to the end,
Till there's me no more,
So another voice
In my place can grow.
Play with all your might,
So I can be heard.
Play with all your care,
So it doesn't hurt.

## You are it

Try to hold your breath,
Try to pause your mind.
Every time you blink
All the world goes blind.

In the thick of life
Try to keep your soul.
Every time you cry
Rivers overflow.

Try to see beyond
All the empty boats.
Every time you're mad
All the souls get hurt.

Everyone you meet -
See them as a child.
Every time you sigh
All the winds go wild.

Try to do away
With what's left inside.
Every time you smile
All the clouds roll by.

Every time you're born,
Simply let it beat.
Every time you die,
Know that you are it.

## Hollow Body

Hollow body, hollow soul,
Let the wind blow through.
Broken heart is taped right on
To her open wound.

Out of touch and out of tune,
Do you feel her spell?
Listen, she is calling to you
Through your cracked shell.

Don't you stop and don't you dare
Let her rock your boat.
Don't you even turn your head
She will cut your throat.

Stolen body, stolen soul,
It's too late to leave.
This is what you get when you
Dare to be naive.
